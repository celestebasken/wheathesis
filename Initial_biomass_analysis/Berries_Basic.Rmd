      Water == "Moderate" ~ 32,
      Water == "Severe"   ~ 16,

  )

```

Parts 1-4 were the first pass

## Part 1: Pretty basic figures

Clustering without regard to PPT:

* Just a note here: I'm using Biomass_g_pp, which is grams per plant of wheat berries. THIS IS IMPORTANT because I forgot to do it at first which meant half the treatments were doubled since this should be considered per capita. Alas.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# Without sorting by ppt at all

ggplot(berries, aes(x = Group, y = Biomass_g_pp, fill = Group)) + 
  geom_col()

```

* In the most basic analysis, the monoculture was about half as productive

The same data is below, but with each pot plotted so you can see the variation within the treatments:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# With each bar individual; as you can see there is a lot of variation, hopefully due to ppt

berries <- read.csv("Biomass/Berry_Weights.csv")

berries <- berries %>%
  mutate(
    Inoculation = factor(Inoculation),
    Polyculture = factor(Polyculture),
    Group = interaction(Inoculation, Polyculture, sep = "_"),
    Rep = factor(row_number())
  )

ggplot(berries, aes(x = Group, y = Biomass_g_pp, fill = Group)) +
  geom_col(aes(group = Rep), position = position_dodge(width = 0.8)) +
  ggtitle("Berry weights by treatment group")

```

## Part 2: Looking at PPT and what the general behavior is

To begin, here's what I would EXPECT the graph to look like:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Biomass/Berries/expected.png")
```
Here's the actual figure with the data:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# With each bar individual and ppt

berries <- read.csv("Biomass/Berry_Weights.csv")

berries <- berries %>%
  mutate(
    Inoculation = factor(Inoculation),
    Polyculture = factor(Polyculture),
    Water = factor(Water, levels = c("Control", "Moderate", "Severe")),
    Group = interaction(Inoculation, Polyculture, sep = "_")
  )

ggplot(berries, aes(x = Group, y = Biomass_g_pp, fill = Water)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  ggtitle("Berry biomass by PPT and treatments")

```
Takeaways

* The Inoc_inter and strl_inter groups are behaving as expected, but the inoc_mono and strl_mono are not (especially strl_mono, which is interesting since it is to an extreme of our treatments)
* This may be explained by intercropping vs monocropping, potentially
* Inoculation seems less significant than intercropping at first pass.
* This kind of makes sense, since that factor is less straightforward. Plus, intercropped plants probably had more room, since the faba didn't do so well.

## Part 3: Analysis using boxplots to look for significant behavior

All of the treatments together looking at water: both as a bar graph and boxplot

```{r}

# Bar graph looking at water with the individual points plotted on trop
ggplot(berries, aes(x = Water, y = Biomass_g_pp)) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "col", width = 0.6) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.15, alpha = 0.6) +
  ggtitle("Berry biomass by PPT, all treatments")


```

```{r}
# The same thing (kind of) but as a boxplot with the scattered points

#This code is redundant but good for copy paste later?
berries <- berries %>%
  mutate(
    Water = factor(Water, levels = c("Control", "Moderate", "Severe"))
  )

# The plot
ggplot(berries, aes(x = Water, y = Biomass_g_pp)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.15, alpha = 0.6) +
  ggtitle("Berry biomass by PPT, all treatments")
```

Takeaways

* There is a difference between severe compared to control and moderate, but not really within control and moderate
* Can I average the control and moderate somehow? Should I? Or should I just remove moderate and have 2 levels of PPT.

## Part 4: Focusing on crop diversity: inter vs mono

Since the main difference in expectation vs data for the berry biomass was in the monocropped treatments, I decided to break down these boxplots by cropping diversity. Here are the individual boxplots, and then side by side:

These first figures combine inoc and strl. First, just monocropped:

```{r}
# Looking at just monocropped

berries <- berries %>%
  mutate(
    Water = factor(Water, levels = c("Control", "Moderate", "Severe")),
    Inoculation = factor(Inoculation),
    Polyculture = factor(Polyculture)
  )

berries_inter <- berries %>%
  filter(Polyculture == "Mono")

ggplot(berries_inter, aes(x = Water, y = Biomass_g_pp)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.15, alpha = 0.6) +
  ggtitle("Berry biomass by PPT, Monocropped treatments only")

```

And looking at intercropped

```{r}
# Looking at just intercropped

berries <- berries %>%
  mutate(
    Water = factor(Water, levels = c("Control", "Moderate", "Severe")),
    Inoculation = factor(Inoculation),
    Polyculture = factor(Polyculture)
  )

berries_inter <- berries %>%
  filter(Polyculture == "Inter")

ggplot(berries_inter, aes(x = Water, y = Biomass_g_pp)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.15, alpha = 0.6) + 
  ggtitle("Berry biomass by PPT, Intercropped treatments only")
```

Let's see that side by side and broken down by inoculation status as well

```{r}
# Splitting it by crop treatment

berries <- berries %>%
  mutate(
    Water       = factor(Water, levels = c("Control", "Moderate", "Severe")),
    Inoculation = factor(Inoculation, levels = c("Strl", "Inoc")),
    Polyculture = factor(Polyculture, levels = c("Inter", "Mono"))
  )

ggplot(berries, aes(x = Water, y = Biomass_g_pp, fill = Inoculation)) +
  geom_boxplot(
    outlier.shape = NA,
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.8)
  ) +
  geom_point(
    aes(color = Inoculation),
    alpha = 0.6,
    size = 1.8,
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.8)
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~ Polyculture) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x = "Water treatment",
    y = "Biomass (g)"
  ) +
  ggtitle("Both Intercropped and Monoculture Berry biomass by PPT")


```

Takeaways

* The intercropped treatments behave more like I expected (confirming first graph)
* In no treatment is there a real difference between control and moderate PPT. It may have to be dropped, if that’s allowed? Unless there is another solution.
* On the bright side, the severe drought worked!

## Part 5 (new day): Continuous ppt

This is generating figures based on total weekly ppt per pot

```{r}

berries_sum <- berries %>%
  group_by(Inoculation, Polyculture, Water_gal_per_wk) %>%
  summarise(mean_biomass = mean(Biomass_g, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Really basic with a line connecting treatment means
ggplot(
  berries_sum,
  aes(
    x = Water_gal_per_wk,
    y = mean_biomass,
    color = interaction(Inoculation, Polyculture),
    group = interaction(Inoculation, Polyculture)
  )
) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Berry biomass by PPT (gallons per week) of all treatment types")

# Slightly less basic, line connecting treatment means but split by polyculture status
ggplot(berries,
       aes(x = Water_gal_per_wk, y = Biomass_g, color = Inoculation, group = Inoculation)) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "line") +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point") +
  facet_wrap(~ Polyculture) +
  ggtitle("Berry biomass by PPT (gallons per week), by polyculture status")

# Slightly less basic, line connecting treatment means but split by AMF status
ggplot(berries,
       aes(x = Water_gal_per_wk, y = Biomass_g, color = Inoculation, group = Polyculture)) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "line") +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point") +
  facet_wrap(~ Inoculation) +
  ggtitle("Berry biomass by PPT (gallons per week), by AMF status")

```
```{r}
# Basic with a smoothed regression line connecting treatment means
ggplot(berries,
       aes(x = Water_gal_per_wk, y = Biomass_g,
           color = interaction(Inoculation, Polyculture))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  ggtitle("Berry biomass by PPT (gallons per week) of all treatment types")

# Basic with a smoothed regression line connecting treatment means, separated by intercropping status

ggplot(berries,
       aes(x = Water_gal_per_wk, y = Biomass_g, color = Inoculation)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ Polyculture) +
  ggtitle("Berry biomass by PPT (gallons per week), by intercropping status")

# Basic with a smoothed regression line connecting treatment means, separated by AMF status

ggplot(berries,
       aes(x = Water_gal_per_wk, y = Biomass_g, color = Polyculture)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ Inoculation) +
  ggtitle("Berry biomass by PPT (gallons per week), by AMF status")

```
