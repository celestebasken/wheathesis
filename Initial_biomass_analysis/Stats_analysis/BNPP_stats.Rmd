# BNPP Wheat Biomass

BNPP <- BNPP %>%

## BNPP statistics

To conclude my BNPP work, let's generate some statistics

Before I begin I want to check some assumptions of a t-test

The boxes shouldn't have overly long tails or outliers. The residuals should be straight.

```{r}
# Check of distributions
ggplot(BNPP, aes(x = Inoculation, y = Biomass_g_pp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.15, alpha = 0.6) +
  facet_wrap(~ Water) +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("BNPP biomass by inoculation status")

# Q–Q plots of residuals
ggplot(BNPP, aes(sample = Biomass_g_pp)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ Inoculation + Water) +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("QQ plot of residuals for inoc status")

```

This next section is generating a variety of summary statistics about the data, and then saving them as CSVs. 

```{r}

# Load + clean
BNPP <- BNPP %>%
  mutate(
    Inoculation = factor(Inoculation, levels = c("Strl", "Inoc")),
    Polyculture = factor(Polyculture, levels = c("Mono", "Inter")),
    Water = factor(Water, levels = c("Control", "Moderate", "Severe"))
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(Biomass_g_pp))

# Descriptive statistics
desc_stats <- function(x) {
  tibble(
    n      = sum(!is.na(x)),
    mean   = mean(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd     = sd(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    se     = sd(x, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(sum(!is.na(x))),
    median = median(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    q25    = quantile(x, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE, names = FALSE),
    q75    = quantile(x, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE, names = FALSE),
    iqr    = IQR(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    min    = min(x, na.rm = TRUE),
    max    = max(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
}

## BNPP statistical analysis

I used AI to generate stats. This should be verified for sure!! Especially to make sure I meet the assumptions to even be using these stats.

```{r}
# These statistics were Chat GPT and should be verified

# P-VALUES: Simple comparisons within each Water ----
# Welch t-tests are robust to unequal variances (default in t.test)

# a) Inoculation effect within each Water (folding Polyculture)
ttest_inoc_within_water <- BNPP %>%
  group_by(Water) %>%
  do(tidy(t.test(Biomass_g_pp ~ Inoculation, data = .))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(Water, estimate1, estimate2, statistic, p.value, conf.low, conf.high, method)

# b) Polyculture effect within each Water (folding Inoculation)
ttest_poly_within_water <- BNPP %>%
  group_by(Water) %>%
  do(tidy(t.test(Biomass_g_pp ~ Polyculture, data = .))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(Water, estimate1, estimate2, statistic, p.value, conf.low, conf.high, method)

# ---- 3-way factorial model (lets you test interactions) ----
# If your data are fairly normal-ish, this is a strong default.
fit_aov <- aov(Biomass_g_pp ~ Inoculation * Polyculture * Water, data = BNPP)
aov_table <- broom::tidy(fit_aov)

# ---- Optional: Nonparametric alternatives (in case assumptions are shaky) ----
# Wilcoxon rank-sum within each Water for Inoculation / Polyculture
wilcox_inoc_within_water <- BNPP %>%
  group_by(Water) %>%
  do(tidy(wilcox.test(Biomass_g_pp ~ Inoculation, data = ., exact = FALSE))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(Water, statistic, p.value, method)

wilcox_poly_within_water <- BNPP %>%
  group_by(Water) %>%
  do(tidy(wilcox.test(Biomass_g_pp ~ Polyculture, data = ., exact = FALSE))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(Water, statistic, p.value, method)

          file.path(("../Biomass/BNPP/Stats"), "wilcox_poly_within_water.csv"),
          row.names = FALSE)


```

```{r}

an1 <- aov(Biomass_g_pp~Polyculture+Inoculation+Water, data= BNPP)
summary(an1)

an2 <- aov(Biomass_g_pp~Polyculture*Inoculation*Water, data= BNPP)
summary(an2)

lm2 <- lm(Biomass_g_pp~Polyculture*Inoculation*Water, data= BNPP)
summary(lm2)
