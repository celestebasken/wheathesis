# ANPP Wheat Biomass

```{r}
# Loading in data to explore

ANPP <- read.csv("Biomass/ANPP_Wheat_Weights.csv")

ANPP <- ANPP %>%
  mutate(
    Inoculation = factor(Inoculation),
    Polyculture = factor(Polyculture),
    Group = interaction(Inoculation, Polyculture, sep = "_")
  )

# Adding a column for continuous water volumes: based on the assumption that the emitters are 2 gal/hr 

ANPP <- ANPP %>%
  mutate(
    Water_gal_per_wk = case_when(
      Water == "Control"  ~ 48,
      Water == "Moderate" ~ 32,
      Water == "Severe"   ~ 16,
      TRUE ~ NA_real_
    )
  )

# Adding a column which is ppt per plant (continuous)

ANPP <- ANPP %>%
  mutate(
    Water_gal_per_plant_wk = Water_gal_per_wk / Num_wheat_pot
  )

```

## Part 1: Pretty basic figures

Clustering without regard to PPT:

* Just a note here: I'm using Biomass_g_pp, which is grams per plant of wheat ANPP.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# Without sorting by ppt at all

ggplot(ANPP, aes(x = Group, y = Biomass_g_pp, fill = Group)) + 
  geom_col() +
  ggtitle("Wheat ANPP biomass broadly by treatment (not accounting for PPT)")

```

Takeaways

* Strl mono is still the smallest, like with the ANPP

The same data is below, but with each pot plotted so you can see the variation within the treatments:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# With each bar individual; as you can see there is a lot of variation, hopefully due to ppt

ANPP <- ANPP %>%
  mutate(
    Inoculation = factor(Inoculation),
    Polyculture = factor(Polyculture),
    Group = interaction(Inoculation, Polyculture, sep = "_"),
    Rep = factor(row_number())
  )

ggplot(ANPP, aes(x = Group, y = Biomass_g_pp, fill = Group)) +
  geom_col(aes(group = Rep), position = position_dodge(width = 0.8))

```

Takeaways
* There is a large outlier potentially in the inoc_inter treatment

## Part 2: Looking at PPT and what the general behavior is

To begin, here's what I would EXPECT the graph to look like:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Biomass/ANPP/expected.png")
```
Here's the actual figure with the data:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# With each bar individual and ppt

ANPP <- ANPP %>%
  mutate(
    Inoculation = factor(Inoculation),
    Polyculture = factor(Polyculture),
    Water = factor(Water, levels = c("Control", "Moderate", "Severe")),
    Group = interaction(Inoculation, Polyculture, sep = "_")
  )

ggplot(ANPP, aes(x = Group, y = Biomass_g_pp, fill = Water)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  ggtitle("Wheat ANPP biomass by PPT and treatments")

```
Takeaways

* Kind of all over the place
* Only strl_inter really makes sense?
* Curious if there is a large outlier in the inoc_inter group
* As compared to the ANPP, the drought seems to have affected ANPP much less for the wheat.

## Part 3: Analyzing these ANPP biomass trends more in depth

All of the treatments together looking at water: both as a bar graph and boxplot

```{r}

# Bar graph looking at water with the individual points plotted on trop
ggplot(ANPP, aes(x = Water, y = Biomass_g_pp)) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "col", width = 0.6) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.15, alpha = 0.6) +
  ggtitle("ANPP biomass by PPT, all treatments")


```

```{r}
# The same thing (kind of) but as a boxplot with the scattered points

#This code is redundant but good for copy paste later?
ANPP <- ANPP %>%
  mutate(
    Water = factor(Water, levels = c("Control", "Moderate", "Severe"))
  )

# The plot
ggplot(ANPP, aes(x = Water, y = Biomass_g_pp)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.15, alpha = 0.6) +
  ggtitle("ANPP biomass by PPT, all treatments")
```

Takeaways

* There definitely seems to be some outlier activity going on
* Nothing really interesting oof

## Part 4: Focusing on crop diversity: inter vs mono


```{r}
# Looking at just monocropped

ANPP <- ANPP %>%
  mutate(
    Water = factor(Water, levels = c("Control", "Moderate", "Severe")),
    Inoculation = factor(Inoculation),
    Polyculture = factor(Polyculture)
  )

ANPP_inter <- ANPP %>%
  filter(Polyculture == "Mono")

ggplot(ANPP_inter, aes(x = Water, y = Biomass_g_pp)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.15, alpha = 0.6) +
  ggtitle("ANPP biomass by PPT, Monocropped treatments only")

```

And looking at intercropped

```{r}
# Looking at just intercropped

ANPP <- ANPP %>%
  mutate(
    Water = factor(Water, levels = c("Control", "Moderate", "Severe")),
    Inoculation = factor(Inoculation),
    Polyculture = factor(Polyculture)
  )

ANPP_inter <- ANPP %>%
  filter(Polyculture == "Inter")

ggplot(ANPP_inter, aes(x = Water, y = Biomass_g_pp)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.15, alpha = 0.6) + 
  ggtitle("ANPP biomass by PPT, Intercropped treatments only")
```

Let's see that side by side and broken down by inoculation status as well

```{r}
# Splitting it by crop treatment

ANPP <- ANPP %>%
  mutate(
    Water       = factor(Water, levels = c("Control", "Moderate", "Severe")),
    Inoculation = factor(Inoculation, levels = c("Strl", "Inoc")),
    Polyculture = factor(Polyculture, levels = c("Inter", "Mono"))
  )

ggplot(ANPP, aes(x = Water, y = Biomass_g_pp, fill = Inoculation)) +
  geom_boxplot(
    outlier.shape = NA,
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.8)
  ) +
  geom_point(
    aes(color = Inoculation),
    alpha = 0.6,
    size = 1.8,
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.8)
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~ Polyculture) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x = "Water treatment",
    y = "Biomass (g)"
  ) +
  ggtitle("Both Intercropped and Monoculture ANPP biomass by PPT")


```

Takeaways

* These data seem totally all over the place
* Crazy tail activity
* Yeah


## Part 5 (new day): Continuous ppt

This is generating figures based on total weekly ppt per pot

```{r}

ANPP_sum <- ANPP %>%
  group_by(Inoculation, Polyculture, Water_gal_per_wk) %>%
  summarise(mean_biomass = mean(Biomass_g, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Really basic with a line connecting treatment means
ggplot(
  ANPP_sum,
  aes(
    x = Water_gal_per_wk,
    y = mean_biomass,
    color = interaction(Inoculation, Polyculture),
    group = interaction(Inoculation, Polyculture)
  )
) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("ANPP biomass by PPT (gallons per week) of all treatment types")

# Slightly less basic, line connecting treatment means but split by polyculture status
ggplot(ANPP,
       aes(x = Water_gal_per_wk, y = Biomass_g, color = Inoculation, group = Inoculation)) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "line") +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point") +
  facet_wrap(~ Polyculture) +
  ggtitle("ANPP biomass by PPT (gallons per week), by polyculture status")

# Slightly less basic, line connecting treatment means but split by AMF status
ggplot(ANPP,
       aes(x = Water_gal_per_wk, y = Biomass_g, color = Polyculture, group = Polyculture)) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "line") +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point") +
  facet_wrap(~ Inoculation) +
  ggtitle("ANPP biomass by PPT (gallons per week), by AMF status")

```
Takeaways:

* There seems to be a significant difference within the inoculated group between the inter and mono

This is the same thing but with a regression line

```{r}
# Basic with a smoothed regression line connecting treatment means
ggplot(ANPP,
       aes(x = Water_gal_per_wk, y = Biomass_g,
           color = interaction(Inoculation, Polyculture))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  ggtitle("ANPP biomass by PPT (gallons per week) of all treatment types") +
  xlab("Gallons of water per week") +
  ylab("Mean ANPP biomass (g)")

# Basic with a smoothed regression line connecting treatment means, separated by intercropping status

ggplot(ANPP,
       aes(x = Water_gal_per_wk, y = Biomass_g, color = Inoculation)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ Polyculture) +
  ggtitle("ANPP biomass by PPT (gallons per week), by intercropping status") +
  xlab("Gallons of water per week") +
  ylab("Mean ANPP biomass (g)")

# Basic with a smoothed regression line connecting treatment means, separated by AMF status

ggplot(ANPP,
       aes(x = Water_gal_per_wk, y = Biomass_g, color = Polyculture)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ Inoculation) +
  ggtitle("ANPP biomass by PPT (gallons per week), by AMF status") +
  xlab("Gallons of water per week") +
  ylab("Mean ANPP biomass (g)")

```

Takeaways

* Once again, within inoculated there seems to be a difference
* Smoothing out the regression line may not be helpful since there is so much similarity between moderate and control

## Part 6: Ppt adjusted by planting density

This section is the same as #5 BUT...

The plan now is to adjust the PPT continuous variable (gallons per minute) to also be per plant. This was done at the top of this doc by adding a new column, which I will now use.

### 6A: Generating with ANPP weights combined

```{r}
ANPP_sum <- ANPP %>%
  group_by(Inoculation, Polyculture, Water_gal_per_plant_wk) %>%
  summarise(mean_biomass = mean(Biomass_g, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Really basic with a line connecting treatment means
ggplot(
  ANPP_sum,
  aes(
    x = Water_gal_per_plant_wk,
    y = mean_biomass,
    color = interaction(Inoculation, Polyculture),
    group = interaction(Inoculation, Polyculture)
  )
) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("ANPP biomass by PPT (gallons per week) of all treatment types", subtitle = "With precipitation adjusted to per-plant density") +
  xlab("Gallons of water per week, density-adjusted") +
  ylab("Mean ANPP biomass (g)")

# Slightly less basic, line connecting treatment means but split by polyculture status
ggplot(ANPP,
       aes(x = Water_gal_per_plant_wk, y = Biomass_g, color = Inoculation, group = Inoculation)) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "line") +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point") +
  facet_wrap(~ Polyculture) +
  ggtitle("ANPP biomass by PPT (gallons per week), by polyculture status", subtitle = "With precipitation adjusted to per-plant density") +
  xlab("Gallons of water per week, density-adjusted") +
  ylab("Mean ANPP biomass (g)")

# Slightly less basic, line connecting treatment means but split by AMF status
ggplot(ANPP,
       aes(x = Water_gal_per_plant_wk, y = Biomass_g, color = Polyculture, group = Polyculture)) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "line") +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point") +
  facet_wrap(~ Inoculation) +
  ggtitle("ANPP biomass by PPT (gallons per week), by AMF status", subtitle = "With precipitation adjusted to per-plant density") +
  xlab("Gallons of water per week, density-adjusted") +
  ylab("Mean ANPP biomass (g)")

```
Takeaways

* Notable difference between 

Because I'm still confused if I should be making these figures with the y axis adjusted per plant? So here it is like that

### 6B: Generating with ANPP weights per plant

```{r}
ANPP_sum <- ANPP %>%
  group_by(Inoculation, Polyculture, Water_gal_per_plant_wk) %>%
  summarise(mean_biomass = mean(Biomass_g_pp, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Really basic with a line connecting treatment means
ggplot(
  ANPP_sum,
  aes(
    x = Water_gal_per_plant_wk,
    y = mean_biomass,
    color = interaction(Inoculation, Polyculture),
    group = interaction(Inoculation, Polyculture)
  )
) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("ANPP biomass by PPT (gallons per week) of all treatment types", subtitle = "With precipitation adjusted to per-plant density") +
  xlab("Gallons of water per week, density-adjusted") +
  ylab("Mean ANPP biomass (g) per plant")

# Slightly less basic, line connecting treatment means but split by polyculture status
ggplot(ANPP,
       aes(x = Water_gal_per_plant_wk, y = Biomass_g_pp, color = Inoculation, group = Inoculation)) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "line") +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point") +
  facet_wrap(~ Polyculture) +
  ggtitle("ANPP biomass by PPT (gallons per week), by polyculture status", subtitle = "With precipitation adjusted to per-plant density") +
  xlab("Gallons of water per week, density-adjusted") +
  ylab("Mean ANPP biomass per plant(g)")

# Slightly less basic, line connecting treatment means but split by AMF status
ggplot(ANPP,
       aes(x = Water_gal_per_plant_wk, y = Biomass_g_pp, color = Polyculture, group = Polyculture)) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "line") +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point") +
  facet_wrap(~ Inoculation) +
  ggtitle("ANPP biomass by PPT (gallons per week), by AMF status", subtitle = "With precipitation adjusted to per-plant density") +
  xlab("Gallons of water per week, density-adjusted") +
  ylab("Mean ANPP biomass per plant (g)")

# Also testing this
# Basic with a smoothed regression line connecting treatment means
ggplot(ANPP,
       aes(x = Water_gal_per_plant_wk, y = Biomass_g_pp,
           color = interaction(Inoculation, Polyculture))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  ggtitle("ANPP biomass by PPT (gallons per week) of all treatment types", 
          subtitle = "Density adjusted for PPT and biomass") +
  xlab("Gallons of water per week, density adjusted per plant") +
  ylab("Mean ANPP biomass per plant (g)")

```
Takeaways

* Okay so this is fascinating because now it looks like the inoc inter did the best (which was my hypothesis) followed by strl inter
* Not much diff in the last one within intercropping between AMF treatments
